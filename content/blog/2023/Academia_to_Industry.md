## Background
I have been thinking a lot about my experience transitioning from academia to the tech industry and my misconceptions of how prepared I actually was. I realize now, that I was prepared in all the wrong ways and what I would do if I could go back and do things differently. 

## Writing
    - From minimum word counts to being as concise as possible.  
    - The corporate dialect - I understand but can’t quite speak or replicate myself.  
    - convey thoughts directly and efficiently.  
    - To leave feelings at the door.  

## Deliverables
    - There is rarely a template.  
    - Many tasks do require some bit of magic to pull answers out of a hat.  
    - Make sure to clarify what is internal vs external deadlines.  
    - How many revisions are needed.  
    - Some companies prefer deliverables in a certain format - pptx.  
    - Some companies prefer text heavy vs not slides.  

## Communication
    - Everyone is different.  
    - Coming in it was typical to be expected to bend your preferences in favor of others.  
    - It is okay to speak up if you feel someone is not respecting your time.  
    - Learning everyone’s communication styles is hard.  
        - You may not always work with someone who matches your work/communication style.  
    - Don’t be afraid to suggest things that might improve processes.  
    - For the love of god document the things you would need to inform someone about if they came in the middle of a project.  
    - You probably cannot be yourself.  
    - Professionalism is still necessary even if you think something is stupid.  

## Overall things that helped
    - Finding a mentor to trust.  
    - Befriending people around the same age.  
    - You can be social even if just with those you think you’ll like.  
        - You dont have to make small talk with everyone.  
    - Find someone who you can ask all your dumb questions to.  
    - Be honest with your manager about the things you’re struggling with, self awareness shows you’re trying to make an improvement.  
    - Find someone who is in the same position but higher up that can validate your thoughts, feelings, and intuition about a topic or process.  
    - I still believe the corp world would be better if people were just real about things.
