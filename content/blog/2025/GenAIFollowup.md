#summary: "Inital thoughts on GenAI."

More and more at my job I keep hearing about things like “if you aren’t using AI everyday or finding ways to incorporate it into your job, you’ll fall behind”. This makes me think about all the discourse about whether AI will be taking everyone’s jobs. I still firmly believe a human element is necessary for all jobs regardless of how much one believes we need to incorporate AI. I think the approach to its incorporation in the workplace day to day is fundamentally flawed. It is a powerful technology and it is really cool to see how it has evolved in such a short period. However, that does not make it some magical cure or solution to all problems, there are still problems with each platform or service. I believe many people are so in awe of its capabilities that it is often mistaken for a replacement for their actual thoughts and effort into solving a problem. 

Personally, I try to utilize it but it is not everyday. I think AI can be used in moderation and that its an excellent tool for skeletal frameworks for what task you might be trying to complete. I don’t think it should (in its current state) be utilized as the final product for anything, especially in academia or the workplace. 

I spoke with my father earlier this year and he asked about my utilization habits with regards to AI and mentioned his organization did a survey about how its being used and the results showed that many if not all the men used it every day, but women were less likely to use it. I had some thoughts on that, which I think stem from sexism in the workplace. From my experience talking with other women at my current and previous jobs, we have all been subject to similar experiences in the workplace where we have had others take credit for, undermine, or criticized to no end. Trying continuously to prove we are deserving of being in the same role and working twice as hard to be prove we should be promoted. I wonder if this trend will continue as utilization becomes more widespread.
