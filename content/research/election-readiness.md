This paper explores previous tabletop exercises and election research conducted on Election Day issues such as line length, accessibility accommodations, and reliability of internet and voting machines. Previous articles discuss the importance of voter turnout and the impact election committees have on it. To address these challenges of Election Day planning, a tabletop exercise was developed for the Tippecanoe County Election Committee in Tippecanoe County, Indiana. This tabletop exercise explores multiple phases of Election Day as well as examples paths designers can use for the phases.
