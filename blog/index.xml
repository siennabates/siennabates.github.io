<p>This is something I would want to do some more research on myself.</p>
<p>I think with the information age there is not just the huge boom of technology and understanding not just how to use it but how it works too, there’s a lot more that as a human race/society we underestimated how much we would need to “absorb” on a regular basis just to stay informed. Technology and the internet gave us infinite knowledge and while there are many things to be informed about, basic concepts like personal security, privacy, and ethics have turned from a single dimensional concept to a multidimensional concept.</p>
<p>This is a wild way to think about it in my opinion because I think that its not that people aren’t interersted or don’t care, though I am sure there is some degree of truth to that too, but I think people just are uninformed and don’t know. The amount of information you need to intake and how things change and evolve over time is quicker in some ways and shorter in others in my opinion. Let me explain a bit further - you can get access to research, blog posts, videos, courses, etc - tons of which can send you down a rabbit hole that might only be a small part of the overall picture. You can see when there’s news updates and developments or new takes on the work that others have done. You can see improvements, regressions, confirmation, tangential works all on the same concept or idea and you can see it as quick as it’s available. However, unless you were a working professional in that field before the internet, you may never have even known about it or had a way to do your own research.</p>
<p>The modern person has somewhat of a moral responsibility in my mind to do their own research and that is how opinions should be formed. Not a singular source or news outlet. There is the added layer of knowing what to look for in reputable sources and how to tell the difference between trustworthy sources and research and biased work that might be misinformation. But a lot of people were not taught how to do that or that they even need to. I think the internet/information age is creating a huge disparity amongst the population for who understands it and can use it effectively. Of course there are outliers such as those who purposefully spread misinformation, but I think even those people understand how it works and how easily influenced an uninformed person can be.</p>

I really enjoyed getting to go again as it is a great opportunity to see some of my friends who live in the Midwest again now that I have moved to California.</p>
<p>On Thursday we arrived late afternoon after a fairly early morning and we met our friends Aaron and G. We got a late lunch before our friends headed off to the speaker dinner ahead of the conference while we took a short nap. Later that night we met up with some more of our friends at their residence near the conference. It was nice to catch up with people I have not seen in a while.</p>
<p>Friday was the first day of the conference and we arrived after taking the blue line from the city. It was surprisingly rainy and a bit chilly on the way there. Shortly after arrival we ordered some lunch to be delivered to the venue. There are some catered options but I wanted to get a lot of my favorite foods while I was in the city. We ordered Fry the Coop for some tasty chicken sandwiches before we attended some talks during the afternoon. After the conference we headed back to the hotel for a short nap prior to dinner at Benihana, one of our favorite places to eat with our friends.</p>
<p>After dinner we headed to the after party which was at the old or original Thotcon location. It was a really neat location with some old school games, and old school cars, and neon signs. I really enjoyed the venue and it was one of the cooler after parties for cons I have been to. There was also TONS of candy for patrons to snack on throughout the night along with a bar of course.</p>
<p>Saturday was a bit of a shitshow. After we got ready, Aaron stayed behind to write out his questions for Hacker Jeopardy while I bullied G and Dade to attend an other favorite restaurants of mine, Nando’s. Following lunch, we had a rather awful experience getting to the con itself. The conference venue is not really near any hotels, mostly surrounded by residential areas. It is about a 30 minute train ride from the city. This con is one I find to be one of the most exhausting to attend. We got on the blue line, but it stopped half way through as they were doing maintenance so we had to take a bus to a later stop then get back on the train to get to our actual stop. We decided to get a Lyft as that was easier, but turned out to be more time consuming as our driver missed multiple exits and did not seem to notice. By the time we got there we could only see a few talks before we needed to go to Hacker Jeopardy. The categories Aaron came up with for the game show this conference were pretty entertaining. I’ve gotten a bit better in my knowledge in how to answer them, but Dade still blows me out of the water by knowing most the answers. My favorite category was about movies but the most entertaining was the ones where evilmog, cillic, and the craven one acted out skits depicting HTTP status codes. After the closing remarks, Dade and I suffered the awful fate of the public transportation on the way back, took almost an hour and a half to arrive back to the hotel. We had a nice dinner before we headed back to the room to pack up our bags and head to bed before our early flight back Sunday morning.</p>

First thing I was excited about was the theme of this year, which was Broadway. The year prior was picnic. I was pretty excited when I saw the booklet that usually contains the schedule and talks with speakers, as well as some challenges and puzzles was made to look like a playbill. Also, there were three different attendee badges were made to represent three different Broadway theaters. Mine was shaped like the New Amsterdam theater, there was also one that represented the Richard Rodgers theater, as well as one other which I cannot remember. Each badge also had a portion of a QR code on the back which if put together correctly could help you embark on the remainder of the badge challenge. The bag with all the promotional swag was pretty cool this year too, it was a collapsible backpack that folds up really nice and is good for travel. I usually don’t use the given bag during the conference, but I liked this one so much I used it the whole tine. Also, coolest swag was definitely the tech deck.</p>
<p>Another cool thing about Shmoocon this year is they had their first book swap - ran by some of our close friends. There was the option to bring a book and receive a token they can bring back the following day to choose a new book to bring home. Participants also received a cool little Shmoocon themed 3D printed poker chip. I hope next year we remember to bring some of our books so we can contribute as well.</p>
<p>I think my favorite thing about this year’s conference was how good all the different talks were. I mean there were so many different ones that seemed interesting it was hard to go to all the ones I wanted due to being scheduled at the same times. I am hoping I will be able to catch the ones I missed when they are finally uploaded. Though there was always the option to buy a copy of the recordings at the conference, but I didn’t have enough money on me to do so at the time.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about the talks this year that I may have just not remembered from the year prior is there were more than two durations of talks. Some were an hour, some half and hour and some were like fifteen minutes. It was nice because I think that allowed for more speakers but it also gave attendees more options to see more talks. One of the shorter ones that I really enjoyed this year was the talk on the D.C. helicopters. Some of the other talks I feel like I learned a lot about and was interested in learning more was Social Engineering from the detectives perspective, textiles and technology, Using Parking Apps like Traditional Meters Using License Plate Validation Loopholes, and Balancing Privacy Breach Notifications with Incident Response. Now, even though the talks varied in length, I have come to really understand why it is important not to rush through presentations. I myself am guilty of that, especially when I am nervous, it was my biggest piece of feedback the week prior when I gave my fist solo presentation to a client at work. It can be difficult to make sure you are talking slowly while still getting your point across  while people are reading slides and developing any questions they may have. I had a bit of trouble keeping up to take notes during some of the shorter talks but overall I still enjoyed that this conference seemed to have more of them than others I have attended.</p>
<p>

<p>But speaking of talks, I had a discussion with Dade after the first day about the talks I had seen that day and he asked whether or not I had seen anything that might have sparked an idea or interest for a project. I thought that was an interesting take and inquiry. I think at this point in my career, I do not feel advanced enough where that is the <strong><strong><strong>reason</strong></strong></strong> I am going to talks. But I do think it is still possible to happen if I found the right area of interest being covered by a speaker. I think I mostly choose the talks I go to based on what overlaps with my areas of interests as well as what looks fun. I really enjoy seeing people discuss their “passion projects” because I believe once I find one for myself I am that passionate about, it would be one worth giving a talk myself about to share that excitement and information with the rest of the community.</p>
<p>On Saturday night there are some options for evening activities. After a lovely dinner, we came back to assist Lintile and Rand0h with the Hacker Bar Trivia game. They also had a board game room with tons of board/table top games for people to play who did not want to participate in the game show or bar. The board game room seemed to replace some sort of “party” that usually took place at the same time prior to covid. This was a nice alternative since masks were required when not directly eating or drinking during the conference.</p>
<p>Lintile made a web app for people to participate this year rather than write on paper and us collect it after each question. It was a pretty neat idea to have done it that way despite some minor hiccups along the way. I ran around the crowd with a microphone for people to give their answers and why - typically I was deployed when someone picked the “obviously” wrong answer.</p>
<p>Following the game show, we met up with some friends in the lobby. The Washington Hilton, where the conference is held, has some really nice bars and open seating for people to hang out and get together. It was really nice to socialize with friends I have not seen in a while though we did not stay too long. With long conferences, especially after a big time zone change and being on a plane most of the day, I try to be back in the room for bed at midnight. Lame, I know. You know what’s not lame? A good night’s sleep.</p>
<p>The final day, I went to a talk in the morning before heading to lunch as Mason’s famous lobster rolls, one of my DC favorites. We got back just in time for the closing ceremonies. The annual “unofficial” game of Rock, Paper, Scissors took place and I did surprisingly well and made it to the finals to earn some extra swag, including my shmoose with a little black hoodie.</p>
<p>After the conference was over I went to the International Spy Museum. I had been as a kid but they have moved to a new location  and renovated the entire thing. It was a whole new experience and definitely a lot cooler as an adult than I thought it was as a kid. We got new secret undercover identities and did different challenges throughout the museum which was really fun. I really enjoyed the cipher exhibit most of all. The museum  really catered to those of all ages which I thought was pretty neat.</p>

<p>Overall, I had a really good time at this conference. I feel like the vibes were so much better than they were last year (not that they were bad). It was so nice to see so many of my con friends as well as see so many cool talks about things I am interested in learning more about. I really enjoy this conference and I hope it is one I can attend regularly, if I can get tickets that is. Though I will say I was pretty proud of myself for beating the website this year on my own to score two tickets on the first round of ticket sales which was also the same day to sign up for verified fan for Taylor Swift Eras tour  and no, I don’t have tickets — YET!</p>

<p>There are 8 domains that the CISSP tests on:</p>
<ol>
<li>security and risk management</li>
<li>asset security</li>
<li>security architecture and engineering</li>
<li>communication and network security</li>
<li>identity and access management</li>
<li>security assessment and testing</li>
<li>security operations</li>
<li>software development security&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Favorite way to study is use study mode and go through practice exams (Boson) and make my best guess at the right answer and then check if im right and if not I read the description as to why. I go through every single question that way and it takes a while but it helps reassuring myself especially when or if I was not confident in my guess.</p>
<p>Since there are so many questions it helped to do this multiple times and then shuffle the questions so I could make sure I wasn&rsquo;t just memorizing answers in order.</p>
<p>Then since the test requires a 700/1000 to pass I went through then without checking my answers and stopped myself at various points like 130/140/150/160 marks and graded how I performed to see how I was doing.  I had to scale the “passing score” to how many I would need right to pass since the practice test grades out of 175 regardless of how many you answer, even though it was likely I was not going to have all 175 questions in the actual exam. I needed about a 123 to “pass” and I thought if I could score that by answering several sets of practice tests at various lengths I would feel pretty confident in my ability to perform well on the day of my real test.</p>
<p>It provided a solid baseline for me to understand how I was doing in comparison to taking the full exams as well as insight into which categories I could use more review on since I know roughly how many are in each category from my initial full runs of the practice tests.</p>
<p>I also will/did use exams C and D when stopping myself to ensure the tests would be the first time I see that set of questions. Each practice exam has the option for randomization, however I did not choose to use this function.</p>
<h2 id="afterthoughts">Afterthoughts</h2>
<p>I did not obtain a passing score this time around, which was a bit of a bummer. I definitely believe I would have performed better with more time to prepare. Lots of major life events occurred for me the past year making it difficult to dedicate the time to study. Also, taking it about a week and a half after taking the CompTIA Sec+ had both positive and negative affects. For that test I did about two to three weeks of intensive studying, reviews, and practice tests and did so only for that exam, which sadly meant I had significantly less time to apply a similar studying methodology to the CISSP. Unfortunately, with the voucher I had and when it expired, today (1.13.23) was the only date available this month for me to be able to take it without paying full price. But on a positive note, I think I got really good understanding of how to do better next time after having taken it the first time. I think I would like to try again later this year, perhaps late summer, early fall.</p>
<p>Some of the things I struggled with was how they do the scoring of the test. There was no opportunity to flag questions to come back to or return to a question once it was answered. I understand since the exam doesn’t have a “set” amount of questions and everyone might have a different number depending on how they answered the previous questions. I am pretty proud of how I did despite not passing. I was about 3/4 of the way through the 175 questions at about 130 before my exam stopped to inform me I did not pass. Given that there are 175 questions, 123 correct would constitute the “700” score needed to pass, which means if you got all questions, you could get AT MOST 52 incorrect responses. Since I got stopped early and did not pass it is safe to assume I answered 53 incorrectly which would eliminate the possibility of me passing even if all 175 questions were presented to me. This would mean I still got about 77 questions correct. Which for a first attempt, with not a lot of study/practice time, I am pretty proud of my ability to answer more questions right then wrong despite not passing. Upon completion, they gave me a printout stating I did not meet the passing score minimum as well as a breakdown of how I performed in each of the knowledge domains. Unfortunately, it does not say how many questions I was given in each domain so far nor how many I got (in)correct of the ones I was given. I think that would have been a nice metric to be included to really understand the breakdown of your performance.</p>

<p>I graduated in May 2020 with my BS in Cybersecurity from Purdue University. I also recently completed my MS in Cyber Forensics in August 2022 after defending my thesis, which was titled “Cybersecurity Industry Needs and the CSEC ABET curriculum analysis”. I also completed/passed EcCouncil’s Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) in Summer of 2021. I currently work as a security researcher at a small security consulting company.</p>
<p>Now, I do NOT believe you need to have this background in order to pass and complete the Security+ certification, so do not let my experience discourage you from taking it. I know of many people who have obtained it without having any college experience nor any formal technical background. My reasoning for taking this certification was to be more confident in the application of my security knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>Now, onto the stuff you wanted to read about in the first place. My preparation began in December 2021 where I took a four-week CompTIA  Security+ certification course. Upon completion of the course, I received a voucher for this exam. Now I was fortunate enough to have the course paid for me by my university; however, I know this may not be an option for others. But CompTIA does usually have some discount codes for the exam vouchers for students, so that might be worth looking into if the price is a concern. The course was instructor lead but with asynchronous assignments including chapter readings, quizzes, practice exams, and videos. Given that I had already completed my BS in cybersecurity at the point of this course, I was already familiar with a lot of the fundamentals covered in the course. The most beneficial part of it was the quizzes to familiarize myself with the types of questions and phrasing of questions I could expect when taking the actual exam.</p>
<p>I took a bit of a break for about a year from studying after the course ended. My exam voucher was good for about a year until the end of January 2023. I slacked a bit in terms of scheduling the exam but decided to take it on January 3, 2023. The version of the exam I took was SY0-601. Beginning in December 2022, I began some more intensive studying as I had not  reviewed the material in a while. I no longer had access to many of the course materials, but with my CompTIA login I was still able to access their provided practice exams. I began taking one of the practice exams once every few days. It consists of between 80-90 questions. There are about five categories or topic areas within security that are covered as well as some problem based/scenario questions as well. The practice tests provided gave a wide pool of questions similarly to the ones that might appear on the exam. I also found many Quizlets online that have similar questions I used as flash cards to help me memorize the concepts, terms, and definitions. If you do not have access to formal material, this is not a bad option. An additional resource I did not use but have heard is helpful for studying for this exam is Professor Messer on YouTube. Below is a table I found and copied from the CompTIA website that compares some of the different industry certifications based on their focus areas. I believe this to be helpful as it shows the comparison between two certifications I have already obtained myself .</p>
<p>
<img class="enclosure" src="/img/secplusceh.jpeg" alt="CompTIA Security&#43; certification comparison to ISC2&amp;rsquo;s SSCP, Ec-Council&amp;rsquo;s CEH, and GIAC&amp;rsquo;s GSEC"  />
</p>
<p>I would say over the course of the three to four weeks, I took about ten practice tests. CompTIA practice test scoring shows you should be scoring about 80% to be considered almost ready and over 90% to be ready for taking the exam. I was scoring in the 70% for many of the practice tests I took. CompTIA Security+ requires a score of 750 to be considered a pass. I think this can be a bit intimidating when you are at the student level and may be used to 70% being passing or even 75% being passing, and having the mindset that 750 would be the same . But remember, the exam is scored out of 900 not 1000, so you would need about an 83% to pass.</p>
<h2 id="post-exam-thoughts">Post Exam Thoughts</h2>
<p>Now, if I could go back, I would highly recommend taking the exam in person in a testing center if it is an option for you. I personally was not a fan of my experience with the proctoring software (OnVUE) that they use for the exam while taking it at home. My test also started late - about 20 minutes after the scheduled start time not including the 30 minutes to check in prior to the exam “starting”. The exam was scheduled for 135 minutes. I would say my total time took longer than that though. About 45-50  minutes for check in before the exam starts, 90 minutes for the exam, and 15 minutes for a questionnaire after the completion of the exam.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this exam was harder than I expected. But I still believe it is a very good entry-level certification for those who are looking for their first job or transitioning into a tech role. I do not think you need to take a CompTIA preparation course or have a formal education in this field in order to pass this certification. This certification covers a wide range of topics in the security umbrella such as: (1)Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities, (2) Architecture and Design, (3) Implementation, (4) Operations and Incident Response, and (5) Governance, Risk, and Compliance. There are tons of  free resources available online via YouTube, Quizlet, textbooks, and practice tests that can be helpful and aid you in passing this certification.</p>
