On Monday I heard back from UC Berkeley about my application to the School of Information’s PhD program. They are unable to offer me a slot for the upcoming school year beginning in Fall 2025. I am pretty disheartened by the news as I really thought I had a good chance and was doing all the right things to make myself an ideal candidate. I know it is a competitive program and they only take a few people every year, sometimes under 5 but never more than 10 and they get hundreds of applicants every year for that program.</p>
<p>While I believe myself to be very smart I do think that I am competing with a lot of other very impressive candidates and I should not be too disappointed about it. Unlike when I was applying for my Master’s, I am still an unknown to this school and I am still a small fish here. I do not think being rejected for this term is the end of the world nor do I think it is the end of my academic educational journey but it might be just closed off for a bit more until I decide to reapply to that program and/or others as well. I also think it is also a bit of a blessing as I have been very fortunate to be able to do so many things I have wanted and put my heart into and I believe it is important to experience not getting something that I really wanted and put a lot of effort into. I think it can be really important for personal development to handle situations like that and how you learn and grow from that experience.</p>
<p>That being said, I do feel very passionate about the topic I was interested in doing my dissertation on and I still would very much like to pursue that research area, I hope I can find a place that will let me continue down that path. For now I will focus on what I can do and keep learning and working at the things that interest me outside of my day job and know that it is not goodbye but see you later for my time in academia.</p>

&lt;p>I have been thinking a lot about my experience transitioning from academia to the tech industry and my misconceptions of how prepared I actually was. I realize now, that I was prepared in all the wrong ways and what I would do if I could go back and do things differently.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="writing">Writing&lt;/h2>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>- From minimum word counts to being as concise as possible.
- The corporate dialect - I understand but can’t quite speak or replicate myself.
- convey thoughts directly and efficiently.
- To leave feelings at the door.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables&lt;/h2>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>- There is rarely a template.
- Many tasks do require some bit of magic to pull answers out of a hat.
- Make sure to clarify what is internal vs external deadlines.
- How many revisions are needed.
- Some companies prefer deliverables in a certain format - pptx.
- Some companies prefer text heavy vs not slides.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="communication">Communication&lt;/h2>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>- Everyone is different.
- Coming in it was typical to be expected to bend your preferences in favor of others.
- It is okay to speak up if you feel someone is not respecting your time.
- Learning everyone’s communication styles is hard.
- You may not always work with someone who matches your work/communication style.
- Don’t be afraid to suggest things that might improve processes.
- For the love of god document the things you would need to inform someone about if they came in the middle of a project.
- You probably cannot be yourself.
- Professionalism is still necessary even if you think something is stupid.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="overall-things-that-helped">Overall things that helped&lt;/h2>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>- Finding a mentor to trust.
- Befriending people around the same age.
- You can be social even if just with those you think you’ll like.
- You dont have to make small talk with everyone.
- Find someone who you can ask all your dumb questions to.
- Be honest with your manager about the things you’re struggling with, self awareness shows you’re trying to make an improvement.
- Find someone who is in the same position but higher up that can validate your thoughts, feelings, and intuition about a topic or process.
- I still believe the corp world would be better if people were just real about things.
