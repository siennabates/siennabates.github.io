On Monday I heard back from UC Berkeley about my application to the School of Information’s PhD program. They are unable to offer me a slot for the upcoming school year beginning in Fall 2025. I am pretty disheartened by the news as I really thought I had a good chance and was doing all the right things to make myself an ideal candidate. I know it is a competitive program and they only take a few people every year, sometimes under 5 but never more than 10 and they get hundreds of applicants every year for that program.</p>
<p>While I believe myself to be very smart I do think that I am competing with a lot of other very impressive candidates and I should not be too disappointed about it. Unlike when I was applying for my Master’s, I am still an unknown to this school and I am still a small fish here. I do not think being rejected for this term is the end of the world nor do I think it is the end of my academic educational journey but it might be just closed off for a bit more until I decide to reapply to that program and/or others as well. I also think it is also a bit of a blessing as I have been very fortunate to be able to do so many things I have wanted and put my heart into and I believe it is important to experience not getting something that I really wanted and put a lot of effort into. I think it can be really important for personal development to handle situations like that and how you learn and grow from that experience.</p>
<p>That being said, I do feel very passionate about the topic I was interested in doing my dissertation on and I still would very much like to pursue that research area, I hope I can find a place that will let me continue down that path. For now I will focus on what I can do and keep learning and working at the things that interest me outside of my day job and know that it is not goodbye but see you later for my time in academia.</p>

I never really thought I would be interested in pursuing a doctorate but thinking about it more and more it doesn’t seem like a terrible idea. I really have a few things I am looking at but the deadline to apply to UC Berkeley is December this year so I have a few months to think about it and get it together. Berkeley is likely the only place I would want to apply due to its proximity for where I live. The worst that can happen is my application is rejected. They only accept about 3-7 students out of hundreds of applicants. I am a bit worried about whether or not I am “good enough” to get in to such a prestigious school. I know everyone says its hard to be successful in tech or security without a CS degree and while I don’t have one yet, I’m also not interested in pursuing one either. There is an Information Systems PhD in the iSchool or information school that seems like it is more appealing to me and would fit the types of things I want to study and learn about.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Recently I was thinking about whether or not I wanted to pursue higher education, well, an even HIGHER education that is.

<p>Since I have a few months before the application is due for the 2025 school year, I will have to narrow down a potential topic for my dissertation. I understand that choosing a topic is difficult and narrowing down a problem statement and research question is a long process too. I changed my research question several times while in graduate school writing my thesis for my masters. I have a topic in mind already that I am very passionate about and am really interested in researching it more for how it ties into personal security for both my professional and personal life. I have heard that being passionate is imperative for success while pursuing a PhD and I can&rsquo;t wrap my head around the idea of why anyone would even bother applying to a program without passion for what they want to do. But thankfully I don&rsquo;t need to be concerned with why other people do things and as long as I am passionate about what I am doing, hopefully that will help me be successful.</p>

<p>This is something I would want to do some more research on myself.</p>
<p>I think with the information age there is not just the huge boom of technology and understanding not just how to use it but how it works too, there’s a lot more that as a human race/society we underestimated how much we would need to “absorb” on a regular basis just to stay informed. Technology and the internet gave us infinite knowledge and while there are many things to be informed about, basic concepts like personal security, privacy, and ethics have turned from a single dimensional concept to a multidimensional concept.</p>
<p>This is a wild way to think about it in my opinion because I think that its not that people aren’t interersted or don’t care, though I am sure there is some degree of truth to that too, but I think people just are uninformed and don’t know. The amount of information you need to intake and how things change and evolve over time is quicker in some ways and shorter in others in my opinion. Let me explain a bit further - you can get access to research, blog posts, videos, courses, etc - tons of which can send you down a rabbit hole that might only be a small part of the overall picture. You can see when there’s news updates and developments or new takes on the work that others have done. You can see improvements, regressions, confirmation, tangential works all on the same concept or idea and you can see it as quick as it’s available. However, unless you were a working professional in that field before the internet, you may never have even known about it or had a way to do your own research.</p>
<p>The modern person has somewhat of a moral responsibility in my mind to do their own research and that is how opinions should be formed. Not a singular source or news outlet. There is the added layer of knowing what to look for in reputable sources and how to tell the difference between trustworthy sources and research and biased work that might be misinformation. But a lot of people were not taught how to do that or that they even need to. I think the internet/information age is creating a huge disparity amongst the population for who understands it and can use it effectively. Of course there are outliers such as those who purposefully spread misinformation, but I think even those people understand how it works and how easily influenced an uninformed person can be.</p>

&lt;p>I was on Facebook around the time I moved to public school from private school and back then, my timeline was only ever people I knew in real life or wanted to. But eventually, it became filled with people I didn’t know or who were tangential friends to even those I barely knew myself whether that be a classmate or someone I went to summer camp with years prior. It became a competition to have the most likes on statuses or how many friends you had in comparison to others.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Earlier this week I saw a tweet about a new social media app. It focuses on using AI edited images of a user into fantasy scenarios or whatever they want really and it got me thinking about how much social media has changed over time. Now disclaimer: this might be my most boomer take as a gen Z individual.</p>
<p>I was on Facebook around the time I moved to public school from private school and back then, my timeline was only ever people I knew in real life or wanted to. But eventually, it became filled with people I didn’t know or who were tangential friends to even those I barely knew myself whether that be a classmate or someone I went to summer camp with years prior. It became a competition to have the most likes on statuses or how many friends you had in comparison to others.</p>
<p>If you are a regular user of the various social media platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter (X), or Facebook, you probable have come across advertisements or reels, shorts, whatever the platform you’re using calls them, about side hustles or the “grindset mindset”. Now, side hustles can be great and this post isn’t to deter people from pursuing them. In fact, if they are in need of or wanting extra income, a side hustle is a good way to do it. This is especially the case due to inflation and how much basic necessities cost these days. But half of my daily content consumption these days is overwhelmed by these type of videos and content and it is not by choice. Specifically those who want to monetize their platforms and who pay to have their content be pushed to the top of users feeds it minimizes the content I am actually interested in seeing most the time. Everyone wants to get rich quick or make significant passive income with little to no effort (this also isn’t a “no one wants to work anymore” post either - just fyi). There are tons of these “influencer” or influencer wannabe types that are promoting Amazon products or things they get for free to promote and in my opinion is contentiously contributing, knowingly or not, to the spread of misinformation.</p>
<p>As a gen Z, a lover of pop culture/wellness/fashion, and security and privacy - the amount of information we’re sharing on an everyday basis is too damn high (MEME). Don’t get me wrong, I love seeing new products, but with thousands of fake or AI generated reviews, I have seen so many people get scammed out of what money they do have for some product that a celebrity or influencer they follow has promoted. This is including but not limited to: skincare, health supplements, clothing, hair care items, accessories, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, etc. So few people seem to have the knowledge of how to even figure out if what they’re looking at is real or not. It doesn’t even need an advanced technological background in order to determine if an image is AI, or photoshopped, if a website is legitimate, or even if its just a troll commenting on photos and videos of a user.</p>
<p>Social media companies are in this constant growth model, to have the most number of users registered and continuously using their product everyday. Each company takes the most favorable aspects of other popular platforms and tries to <em>poorly</em> implement it into their own platform. The most prevalent example is TikTok - formerly Musical.ly. TikTok has its own issues with how the data is handled with their platform and has even had debates on whether or not it should be banned in the US because of it (LINK) - that’s a discussion for another post. TikTok is massively popular amongst the younger generations and its clear to see why. More often than not these days, many articles contain links to TikTok videos sharing their experience with a particular interaction, location, store, restaurant, or other individual. Other platforms such as Facebook (Meta), Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube have seen the popularity with this model of short videos and decided to make their own variation of it. But by trying to adopt the next big thing, they all are slowly making their initial value and appeal diminish. There is no individual appeal anymore for most of these applications because they all want to be the one application everyone uses for everything instead of sticking to what they are good at or what their initial intended purpose was. And honestly, as a consumer, that straight up sucks. It becomes almost impossible as a regular (non influencer) user to keep a solid presence on all of these platforms because of how much and what types of content you need to post just to show up in a feed, which I also believe contributes to the oversharing necessary to stay “relevant”.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: BOOMER TAKE AHEAD</p>
<p>I miss the “good old days” where I could just interact with my friends and hear their thoughts and opinions about things going on in their life. I even miss the slight sense of jealousy I got only a few years ago, when it felt like all my friends were getting engaged, buying homes, or starting families while I was finishing up my degree. I miss getting to see the accomplishments of my peers, colleagues, classmates, and to be entirely honest - their parents, regardless of how small and insignificant they may seem. Social media was all about sharing things you’re proud of and want to share with your followers and follow the things YOU wanted to see, not advertisements, scams, and paid promotional content, every other post. Now the shift has been quite noticeable, the people I know who are doing well and making great strides for themselves in their personal lives and careers - don’t post about it because they don’t feel its “enough”. And the people who just want to promote stuff are filling timelines with posts that are insignificant, unrelatable, and unobtainable at the rate they’re occurring. But what is “enough” to warrant a post anymore? It is entirely subjective, but it always has been, just now, everyone seems to be following the pattern of what is popular and what gets the most engagement and unfortunately its not things like getting a promotion at your job, or gaining new skills for a hobby, or graduating with a degree from higher education, it’s not even just being proud of something regardless of the reason. I just find it so discouraging and sad.</p>
