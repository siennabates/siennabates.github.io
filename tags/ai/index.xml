This makes me think about all the discourse about whether AI will be taking everyone’s jobs. I still firmly believe a human element is necessary for all jobs regardless of how much one believes we need to incorporate AI.

I believe many people are so in awe of its capabilities that it is often mistaken for a replacement for their actual thoughts and effort into solving a problem.</p>
<p>Personally, I try to utilize it but it is not everyday. I think AI can be used in moderation and that its an excellent tool for skeletal frameworks for what task you might be trying to complete. I don’t think it should (in its current state) be utilized as the final product for anything, especially in academia or the workplace.</p>
<p>I spoke with my father earlier this year and he asked about my utilization habits with regards to AI and mentioned his organization did a survey about how its being used and the results showed that many if not all the men used it every day, but women were less likely to use it. I had some thoughts on that, which I think stem from sexism in the workplace. From my experience talking with other women at my current and previous jobs, we have all been subject to similar experiences in the workplace where we have had others take credit for, undermine, or criticized to no end. Trying continuously to prove we are deserving of being in the same role and working twice as hard to be prove we should be promoted. I wonder if this trend will continue as utilization becomes more widespread.</p>

The amount of teachers retiring and discussing how their students lack basic skills for literacy and critical thinking is staggering. I see so many posts on various social medias taking specific stances or commenting about a recent issue without actually doing any reading and follow up. Like it’s absolutely fine to have a wrong stance on something (I do believe some things are fundamentally correct or not correct than up for debate on). However posing their stance as fact or because of what a specific article says and people always want a shortened version because reading is a lot of engagement and our society is moving its focus to short form content. This can be damaging because people just want to read a headline or quote and don’t actually understand it can be taken out of context and used to spread misinformation - and people just don’t care.&lt;/p></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>We saw a massive dip in the educational quality students were getting during and post Covid.

This can be damaging because people just want to read a headline or quote and don’t actually understand it can be taken out of context and used to spread misinformation - and people just don’t care.</p>
<p>But I think with the use of AI it will only exacerbate this issue. It’s like no one wants to fact check these days. I think putting AI in everything I am interested to see what kind of policies will be passed surrounding the use of AI. There’s the whole deal with Adobe recently. How AI will use our data and information? Will we ever own anything again - or are we perpetually suck in a subscription for life? (Curious to know how that as a whole affects people vs outright owning things like back in the day in a financial sense) is anything we create going to be used to train a LLM? Also who is at fault if something bad happens? Is it the company, is it on the user as their policy prevents them from acknowledging or being responsible for any wrongdoing? What if their product is used to create misinformation or content that harms others?</p>
<p>With even the most educated and knowledgeable people still having the occasional difficulty identifying when something is AI generated - how will we adjust to those who can’t tell? Will anything be “real” or human generated? I fear places like Facebook will just be AI engagement farms and I think that the jobs that are more likely at risk are newer ones than older ones. Specifically, I would bet content creators will become more permanently obsolete than tech workers. However, I also think there will be a large dip for very quickly for tech workers but the demand will be back quicker. I think the opposite will be true for content creators. I think it’ll be easier for brands to use a trained LLM to create content and for a cheaper price too and there will be less “human” advocacy for products and services. I think that with minimal media literacy, the average person won’t be able to tell the difference between an AI content creator and a human one. I think the decline could even be just as fast but the change is less noticeable to the untrained eye.</p>

&lt;p>I was on Facebook around the time I moved to public school from private school and back then, my timeline was only ever people I knew in real life or wanted to.

Now disclaimer: this might be my most boomer take as a gen Z individual.</p>
<p>I was on Facebook around the time I moved to public school from private school and back then, my timeline was only ever people I knew in real life or wanted to. But eventually, it became filled with people I didn’t know or who were tangential friends to even those I barely knew myself whether that be a classmate or someone I went to summer camp with years prior. It became a competition to have the most likes on statuses or how many friends you had in comparison to others.</p>
<p>If you are a regular user of the various social media platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter (X), or Facebook, you probable have come across advertisements or reels, shorts, whatever the platform you’re using calls them, about side hustles or the “grindset mindset”. Now, side hustles can be great and this post isn’t to deter people from pursuing them. In fact, if they are in need of or wanting extra income, a side hustle is a good way to do it. This is especially the case due to inflation and how much basic necessities cost these days. But half of my daily content consumption these days is overwhelmed by these type of videos and content and it is not by choice. Specifically those who want to monetize their platforms and who pay to have their content be pushed to the top of users feeds it minimizes the content I am actually interested in seeing most the time. Everyone wants to get rich quick or make significant passive income with little to no effort (this also isn’t a “no one wants to work anymore” post either - just fyi). There are tons of these “influencer” or influencer wannabe types that are promoting Amazon products or things they get for free to promote and in my opinion is contentiously contributing, knowingly or not, to the spread of misinformation.</p>
<p>As a gen Z, a lover of pop culture/wellness/fashion, and security and privacy - the amount of information we’re sharing on an everyday basis is too damn high (MEME). Don’t get me wrong, I love seeing new products, but with thousands of fake or AI generated reviews, I have seen so many people get scammed out of what money they do have for some product that a celebrity or influencer they follow has promoted. This is including but not limited to: skincare, health supplements, clothing, hair care items, accessories, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, etc. So few people seem to have the knowledge of how to even figure out if what they’re looking at is real or not. It doesn’t even need an advanced technological background in order to determine if an image is AI, or photoshopped, if a website is legitimate, or even if its just a troll commenting on photos and videos of a user.</p>
<p>Social media companies are in this constant growth model, to have the most number of users registered and continuously using their product everyday. Each company takes the most favorable aspects of other popular platforms and tries to <em>poorly</em> implement it into their own platform. The most prevalent example is TikTok - formerly Musical.ly. TikTok has its own issues with how the data is handled with their platform and has even had debates on whether or not it should be banned in the US because of it (LINK) - that’s a discussion for another post. TikTok is massively popular amongst the younger generations and its clear to see why. More often than not these days, many articles contain links to TikTok videos sharing their experience with a particular interaction, location, store, restaurant, or other individual. Other platforms such as Facebook (Meta), Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube have seen the popularity with this model of short videos and decided to make their own variation of it. But by trying to adopt the next big thing, they all are slowly making their initial value and appeal diminish. There is no individual appeal anymore for most of these applications because they all want to be the one application everyone uses for everything instead of sticking to what they are good at or what their initial intended purpose was. And honestly, as a consumer, that straight up sucks. It becomes almost impossible as a regular (non influencer) user to keep a solid presence on all of these platforms because of how much and what types of content you need to post just to show up in a feed, which I also believe contributes to the oversharing necessary to stay “relevant”.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: BOOMER TAKE AHEAD</p>
<p>I miss the “good old days” where I could just interact with my friends and hear their thoughts and opinions about things going on in their life. I even miss the slight sense of jealousy I got only a few years ago, when it felt like all my friends were getting engaged, buying homes, or starting families while I was finishing up my degree. I miss getting to see the accomplishments of my peers, colleagues, classmates, and to be entirely honest - their parents, regardless of how small and insignificant they may seem. Social media was all about sharing things you’re proud of and want to share with your followers and follow the things YOU wanted to see, not advertisements, scams, and paid promotional content, every other post. Now the shift has been quite noticeable, the people I know who are doing well and making great strides for themselves in their personal lives and careers - don’t post about it because they don’t feel its “enough”. And the people who just want to promote stuff are filling timelines with posts that are insignificant, unrelatable, and unobtainable at the rate they’re occurring. But what is “enough” to warrant a post anymore? It is entirely subjective, but it always has been, just now, everyone seems to be following the pattern of what is popular and what gets the most engagement and unfortunately its not things like getting a promotion at your job, or gaining new skills for a hobby, or graduating with a degree from higher education, it’s not even just being proud of something regardless of the reason. I just find it so discouraging and sad.</p>
