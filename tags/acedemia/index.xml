I really have a few things I am looking at but the deadline to apply to UC Berkeley is December this year so I have a few months to think about it and get it together.

<p>Since I have a few months before the application is due for the 2025 school year, I will have to narrow down a potential topic for my dissertation. I understand that choosing a topic is difficult and narrowing down a problem statement and research question is a long process too. I changed my research question several times while in graduate school writing my thesis for my masters. I have a topic in mind already that I am very passionate about and am really interested in researching it more for how it ties into personal security for both my professional and personal life. I have heard that being passionate is imperative for success while pursuing a PhD and I can&rsquo;t wrap my head around the idea of why anyone would even bother applying to a program without passion for what they want to do. But thankfully I don&rsquo;t need to be concerned with why other people do things and as long as I am passionate about what I am doing, hopefully that will help me be successful.</p>
