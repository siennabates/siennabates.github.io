&lt;h2 id="writing">Writing&lt;/h2>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>- From minimum word counts to being as concise as possible.
- The corporate dialect - I understand but can’t quite speak or replicate myself.

&lt;h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables&lt;/h2>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>- There is rarely a template.
- Many tasks do require some bit of magic to pull answers out of a hat.
- Make sure to clarify what is internal vs external deadlines.
- How many revisions are needed.
- Some companies prefer deliverables in a certain format - pptx.

- Coming in it was typical to be expected to bend your preferences in favor of others.
- It is okay to speak up if you feel someone is not respecting your time.
- Learning everyone’s communication styles is hard.
- You may not always work with someone who matches your work/communication style.
- Don’t be afraid to suggest things that might improve processes.
- For the love of god document the things you would need to inform someone about if they came in the middle of a project.
- You probably cannot be yourself.
- Professionalism is still necessary even if you think something is stupid.

&lt;pre>&lt;code>- Finding a mentor to trust.
- Befriending people around the same age.
- You can be social even if just with those you think you’ll like.
- You dont have to make small talk with everyone.
- Find someone who you can ask all your dumb questions to.
- Be honest with your manager about the things you’re struggling with, self awareness shows you’re trying to make an improvement.
- Find someone who is in the same position but higher up that can validate your thoughts, feelings, and intuition about a topic or process.
- I still believe the corp world would be better if people were just real about things.
